		<h1>About</h1>
		<h2>General purpose</h2>
<p>Algorithm visualization is a simple project designed to help understand how sorting algorithms work. It is essential knowledge how to sort your data because programmers encounter this problem every day. This site allows you to learn and understand how some of the most relevant sorting algorithms work.</p>

		<h2>The reason for creating this project</h2>
		<p>This project was created for course credit in my studies. The project requirement was to build a static website using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. I wanted to revise algorithms and data structures and create something useful for others. I think this was a great idea because it gave me a lot of fun, and I have achieved one of my programming goals.</p>

		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>I am a computer science student, not afraid of making something cool. I know C#, and I use it for backend development. This project helped me to learn vanilla (without any other tools) JavaScript to understand frontend development. Now I am more fluent in JavaScript, so I will try to start learning Angular as my frontend framework. I would love to learn React, Vue, and Svelte, but it is too time-consuming. In the meantime, I think I will start a journey with competitive programming, as problem-solving is my current weakness.</p>
